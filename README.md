## Project Overview

<b>IUT CaféCache</b> is a <b>C++ console-based cafeteria management system</b> designed to
digitalize the existing manual token and payment workflow of the IUT cafeteria.
The system focuses on improving speed, transparency, and usability for
<b>non-residential students and teachers</b>.

The project simulates a real-world backend system by handling users, wallets,
e-tokens, menu items, transactions, and administrative controls entirely from scratch.
